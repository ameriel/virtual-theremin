Use the arrow keys to control the right hand, and the a/s/w/d keys to control the left. Press the space bar to stop/start the sound.

The right-hand antenna controls pitch – the closer a hand comes to it the lower the pitch. The left-hand antenna controls volume – the closer a hand comes to it the quieter.
